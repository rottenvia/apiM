 * What the agent has learned about this project, and how it unlearns it.
 *
 * The existing "Self-Critic" plugin is a sentence in the prompt telling the
 * model to review its work. Nothing is written down and nothing persists, so
 * every reply starts from zero and the same wrong turn gets taken again. It
 * is advice, not learning.
 *
 * A lesson here is different in one specific way: it must come from something
 * that actually happened. A command exited non-zero, a tool returned an
 * error, a test passed. Speculation — "there might be a race condition here"
 * — is exactly what the plugin already does badly and is not a lesson.
 *
 * The important part is that lessons are falsifiable. Each one records the
 * evidence that produced it, so when reality later contradicts it, it can be
 * corrected automatically rather than sitting there being wrong forever. The
 * arbiter is the exit code, not the model's opinion of its own note.
 *
 * Scope is one workspace, which is one chat. Lessons about a Chrome extension
 * are noise in a Roblox project, and worse than noise if the model tries to
 * apply them.
