/**
 * Keeping a long agent transcript from growing without bound.
 *
 * Every round resends the whole conversation, so the full text of a file read
 * on round three is paid for again on rounds four through forty. Once the
 * model has acted on that content it is dead weight — but the fact that the
 * read happened, and what it found, still matters.
 *
 * So old tool results are collapsed to a one-line placeholder rather than
 * removed. The model can still see the shape of what it did; if it genuinely
 * needs the content again it re-reads the file, which costs one round and
 * happens rarely.
 *
 * Three invariants this must never break, all of which produce a 400 from
 * DeepSeek if violated:
 *
 *   - every `tool_call` keeps a matching `tool` reply
 *   - `reasoning_content` stays verbatim on tool-calling assistant turns
 *   - the system prompt and the user's question are never touched

 * "[earlier read_file result … collapsed]". The model was not being lazy and
 * had not lost the thread: the content really was gone from the request, so
 * it answered about the handful it could still see. Worse, it then had no
 * reason to believe the files existed at all, which is how a follow-up
 * question ended in "No ZIP in the workspace".
