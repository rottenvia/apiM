/**
 * Image understanding for a text-only model.
 *
 * DeepSeek's V4 API accepts text only — there is no documented image input on
 * the hosted Chat Completions endpoint. So images are described first, and
 * only that description reaches DeepSeek.
 *
 * Ox Alpha and Qwen 3.8 27B are native VLMs: do not call this helper for
 * those. The composer gates `/api/vision` on `modelNeedsVisionHelper`.
 *
 * Preferred path is an OpenAI vision model (layout, highlighted controls,
 * what looks wrong). When the user has no key or the key is out of credit,
 * the server-only helper in `ocr.ts` scrapes visible text with free local
 * OCR. This file must stay free of Node-only imports — ChatArea uses
 * `isImageFile` in the browser.

Describe the image completely enough that someone reading only your description could answer questions about it.

- Transcribe ALL visible text exactly, preserving code indentation and line breaks.
- For code or terminal output, reproduce it verbatim inside a fenced code block with the right language.
- For errors, give the full message, file paths and line numbers exactly.
- For a UI, describe the layout, what is where, and anything that looks broken, misaligned or cut off.
- For charts or diagrams, state the structure, labels and the values or relationships shown.
- Note anything visually wrong even if not asked.

Be factual. Never guess at text that is unreadable — say it is unclear instead.
Do not add commentary, opinions or a preamble. Output only the description.`;
