/**
 * Attacking my own work.
 *
 * Run:  npm run test:adversarial
 *
 * Every check here started as a hole that existed. I wrote the plan system,
 * the budget cap and the read-only exemption, then went looking for ways to
 * defeat them — and found six. This file is the record, so they cannot come
 * back quietly.
 *
 * The framing that matters: none of these need a malicious model. A model
 * under pressure to finish takes the cheapest path to "done", and if the
 * cheapest path is to rewrite its own plan, that is the path it will take.
 * A guard that can be satisfied without doing the work is not a guard, it is
 * a formality.
