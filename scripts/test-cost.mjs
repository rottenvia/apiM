/**
 * The things that decide what a reply costs.
 *
 * Run:  npm run test:cost
 *
 * Two mechanisms are checked here, both of which were found by measuring
 * rather than reading (`npm run cost:lab`):
 *
 *   1. Tree deltas. DeepSeek's cache matches a prefix, so the workspace
 *      listing must be APPENDED to, never moved or rewritten. Getting this
 *      wrong is invisible — nothing breaks, it just costs a third more.
 *
 *   2. The spending limit. It has to stop between rounds, leave the run
 *      resumable, and never fire when no cap was set.
